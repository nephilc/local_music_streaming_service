-could use this instead of a redirect
-putting thing in a parapraphe will put them in the same line, less css code.
-now let's see if i can put those login containers in different files and then include them.
-the best way to include html is to use jquery loads. or just use php includes at the server level, put the code to be included in html files.
-all it takes is one container not 100.



-do not make for mobile and website at once. these are two different websites basically, not just a website with a flexible layout.
combine the two using media queries in css and js.

-using the vh with children may create an extra space that causes scrolling.

-always include a border style.
-some eleents margin causing the page to overscroll.
-prefer padding over margin

-prefer percentages over vh, vh causes iverscroll
-dont use vh and vw, or do overscroll x and y hidden, hopefully not causing problems with position later.

-i found vh necessary for bg image. avoid bg position

-the use of vh at least with the body element is necessary

-ignore overscroll must be useful

-minification and ofuscation algorithms.

-the discography of an artist, albums, singles and eps, the artist page	
-add the number of listens toa track
-also the righys holder for all tracks, albums, singles and eps. apparently for spot singles are single, but they are in aplaylist so they coulb be more
-tracks are always presented in playlist form, playlist should be in a different layer.


-when you acces a web site, in a way, you are in a directory in another computer.
-so viewport size is not screen resolution, viewport size can way smalle than screen resolution, usually half. Viewport x DPR = Screen Resolution
-defining breakpoints. for a phone it is around 400px(360-480(note 5, one plus)), for a tablet it is around 700px(600-800)
-now all is left is knowing viewport desktop sizes.

#########naming convetion for difference, some times a css file mdule contains two classes, the question is how to name thes css fie n away that links it to the
elements it styles without requiring storage in the same folder?
-first i thought of adding code to the elements doc nales and the css modules. so when including a module, you would know exactly what css file to include
based on it's name.
-or the css filename should be tha hash combination of all classes that it contains.
-by the way, the name of the html elements docs, is the names of their classes.
-for now iput the css and html code in the same directory, it has pros and cons.
