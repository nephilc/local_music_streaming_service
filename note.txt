-could use this instead of a redirect
-putting thing in a parapraphe will put them in the same line, less css code.
-now let's see if i can put those login containers in different files and then include them.
-the best way to include html is to use jquery loads. or just use php includes at the server level, put the code to be included in html files.
-all it takes is one container not 100.



-do not make for mobile and website at once. these are two different websites basically, not just a website with a flexible layout.
combine the two using media queries in css and js.

-using the vh with children may create an extra space that causes scrolling.

-always include a border style.
-some eleents margin causing the page to overscroll.
-prefer padding over margin

-prefer percentages over vh, vh causes iverscroll
-dont use vh and vw, or do overscroll x and y hidden, hopefully not causing problems with position later.

-i found vh necessary for bg image. avoid bg position

-the use of vh at least with the body element is necessary

-ignore overscroll must be useful

-minification and ofuscation algorithms.
